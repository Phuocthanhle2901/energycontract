# FE Team 4: Website selling technology products

### I. Project Structure

The following is the defined directory structure for our project:

- **Components**: This is where you will code all the components of the project.
- **Constants**: This folder will store constants and mock data to be used throughout the project.
- **Contexts**: This is where all the contexts of the project will be maintained.
- **Hooks**: This folder will contain all the custom hooks of the project.
- **Layouts**: Specific layouts such as headers and footers will be coded in this directory.
- **Pages**: This is where the pages of the system will be stored.
- **Redux**: This folder is designated for the Redux state management of the project (do not modify the code unless you fully understand it).

### II. Libraries Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: We will use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling across the entire project (do not add other libraries as they may cause code conflicts).
- **SASS**: SASS will be used for custom styling if needed.
- **@material-tailwind/react**: This library integrates with Tailwind CSS to provide some layouts similar to Material UI (MUI).
- **react-hook-form and yup**: These libraries will be used for handling forms within the project.
- **react-router-dom**: This library is used for routing in the project.
- **React Query**: This will be used to fetch data from APIs.
- **Redux (Redux Toolkit and Redux Persist)**: This is for state management and data storage within the system.
